Governments can frame such environmental issues in various ways, but consensus is lacking on whether economic or environmental benefits most effectively encourage pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors, such as supporting PV technology. In this study, we introduce a moderator—psychological distance between citizens and policy outcomes—to elaborate this relation. Based on the federalism literature, we suggest that different levels of government, as the policy implementers, represent a sense of distance. The construal level theory (CLT) is adopted, and we hypothesize that the congruency between psychological distance and the construal level of policy outcomes will increase positive behavioral intentions to support solar PV installation. The results of survey experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) offer partial support for our theoretical expectations and add new insights. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.","tags":null,"title":"Does City or State Make A Difference?

The influences of media partisanship and political elites’ attitude on public opin- ion have been well documented separately, however, their interaction effects are generally overlooked. To fill in this gap, we conduct an experiment to test how partisan media and politicians’ judgments jointly affect public percep- tion of the credibility of performance information under two circumstances; first, when party elites of both incumbent and opposition coalitions endorse the information, and second, when opposition party elites challenge it. We find that bipartisan consensus on the credibility of governmental performance information could lead the public to believe the information published by the out-group media is less credible than the one published by the in-group me- dia. Surprisingly, both government and opposition party supporters would align their attitudes with the government-leaning media which posts opposi- tion party elites challenge on the credibility of information. The insights have implications for public administrators who want to build citizens support by releasing positive performance information about the government.","tags":null,"title":"Partisan Media, Political Cues, and the Credibility of Information on Government Performance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chien-shih Huang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588291200,"objectID":"8e4903779e8795bb7160ecfe16a1c7c8","permalink":"https://www.chienshih.com/publication/working-paper/paper2/","publishdate":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/working-paper/paper2/","section":"publication","summary":"Municipal efforts to promote sustainable development are geographically and temporally uneven across the country. Although cross-sectional research informs our understanding of contextual and institutional factors that drive municipal commitments to sustainability, the agency of policy change at the individual level is not well documented. This article examines the context of executive turnover, in particular, city mayors and managers. Specifically, the author hypothesizes a disruptive or adaptive effect of executive turnover would depend on who leaves and who succeeds in the office. Employing the two- wave ICMA sustainability survey of more than 400 cities, the hypotheses are tested using longitudinal analysis. The results indicate managerial turnover in general is associated with reduced sustainability policy adoptions while only the departure of mayors assertively committing to sustainability would lead to the same negative effect. More sustainability policy adoptions would be conditioned on hiring outsider managers, early in their tenure.","tags":null,"title":"Executive Turnover and Policy Change in Municipal Sustainable Development","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chien-shih Huang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583020800,"objectID":"94f89e9d3bfa94d3b0ede4fd9506e8fb","permalink":"https://www.chienshih.com/publication/book-review/article1/","publishdate":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/book-review/article1/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Book review：Collaborative innovation in the public sector.(書評：協力治理如何使得公部門創新？)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Built on the literature of “bureaucracy bashing,” this paper identifies four dimensions of bureaucracy bashing and explores each dimension using a content analysis of headlines from two national newspapers, the United Daily and the Liberty Times, from 1988 to 2013. The content analysis shows, first, the number of newspaper headlines about civil servants has increased with Taiwan’s democratization. However, the overall image of civil servants presented in headlines tends to be negative. Second, the claim that politicians seeking election tend to present more criticism of civil servants is partially supported. Third, the image of civil servants presented in headlines before and after two turnovers of political power was found not to be significantly different. Last, political bias among news media outlets is associated with the number of negative headlines about civil servants. For United Daily, the tone in headlines was more favorable to civil servants during the Kuomintang regime, compared with the time when Democratic Progressive Party controlled the government. The research presents a preliminary analysis of headlines about civil servants in Taiwan, suggests new directions for the future study and encourages discussion about the ideal role and potential impacts of the media on democratic accountability.","tags":null,"title":"A content analysis of newspaper headlines about civil servants in Taiwan (反官僚現象 - 以公務人員相關之頭版新聞報導為分析素材)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://www.chienshih.com/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

However, both the Kuomintang and the Democratic Progressive Party nodded in agreement on this issue as long as they were the ruling parties. Does the fusion of the two roles really make the passage of government bills easier? Most of the existing literature neglected the important factor of a president acting as a party chairman, and hence provided no answer to this question. In actual practice, we observed several cases of failures in securing the passage of government bills in the Legislative Yuan even after a president was named the chairman of the ruling party. In this article, we argue that, other factors being equal, the fusion of the two roles does enhance the probability of the passage of government bills. In our arguments, two reasons explain why this relation holds. Firstly, when a president acts as the party chairman, he/she does not need to rely on an agent to help him/her achieving policy goals, and can ensure the party’s policy preferences are exactly the same as his/her own. A president acting as a party chairman can also directly lead the party in the Legislative Yuan and better ensure support from the party’s legislators. Secondly, a president acting as party chairman also helps induce a more cooperative stance among the opposition parties because of the following reasons. The first is that a more cohesive ruling party under a president’s leadership as the party chairman is more likely to gain public support, which in turn makes opposition parties more likely to adopt more cooperative stances on some government bills. The second is that a president acting as a party chairman will help his party policy stances move closer to those of the median voter, and these policy stances will be more likely to gain public support, inducing opposition parties to follow suit, at least on some government bills. The empirical findings provide supportive evidence for the hypothesis of this article.","tags":null,"title":"Presidents as party chairman and the passage of government bills：An analysis of Chen Shui-bian's presidency (總統兼任黨主席對政府法案通過的影響：陳水扁政府時期的分析)","type":"publication"}]
